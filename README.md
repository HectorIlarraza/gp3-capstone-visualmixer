# MIXLE
Mixle is an audio manipulation game.  
A random song is picked each day and users are able to create a mix using various audio effects.
Once a mix is complete the user can submit their mix for the world to hear.
Listen to and vote on other users mixes in the "Mixes" section.
All users are given 3 votes to vote on their favorite mixes.  
May the best mix win!
